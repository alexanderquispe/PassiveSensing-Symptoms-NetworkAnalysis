 Combining Passive Sensing and Self-Reported Symptoms with Network Analysis to Predict Suicidal Ideation in Medical Residents

 Medical residents experience high levels of occupational stress, which elevates
their vulnerability to mental health challenges, including suicidal ideation. This
study aims to develop a predictive framework for identifying suicide risk in this
population by constructing networks from passive sensing data (e.g., step count,
sleep metrics) and self-reported mental health assessments (e.g., daily mood rat-
ings, PHQ-9, GAD-7). Using data from the Intern Health Study conducted in
2018–2019, we will employ graph-based machine learning to capture complex,
temporal relationships among these behavioral and psychological variables. Key
network-derived topological features, such as degree centrality and clustering
coefficients, will be extracted and used to train machine learning classifiers. Com-
parative evaluations of traditional classifiers and advanced graph neural network
(GNN) architectures will be conducted to assess both predictive accuracy and
interpretability. By using graph-based ML to preserve the networked nature of
mental health and behavioral data, this project aims to develop a predictive tool for
detecting suicide risk among medical residents, supporting targeted intervention
strategies in high-stress professional environments.
